===================

the webextension-polyfill.js is from https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill.git
Currently v0.12.0 built with the webextension-polyfill target in the Makefile
The code is just bundled but not minified.

unsafe assignment to innerHTML
==============================

There are in two code locations, where innerHTML is assigned. They both refer to i18n string replacements
and are thus not untrusted content, as the content is provided with the extension translation.
