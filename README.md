# gopassbridge

A web extension for Firefox and Chrome to insert login credentials from [gopass](https://www.gopass.pw)

## Summary

[Gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) is the awesome command line password manager.
This plugin enables input of login credentials from gopass.
To access gopass, a native app has to be configured in the browser in addition to installing this extension. 
The native app is a wrapper that calls `gopass-jsonapi` to communicate via stdin/stdout.

## Setup

### Install browser extension

#### Firefox Extension

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gopass-bridge/

#### Chrome / Chromium Extension

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gopass-bridge/kkhfnlkhiapbiehimabddjbimfaijdhk

#### Build and install browser extension from source

See `Makefile` release target. For Firefox, the development plugin can be installed only temporarily while for Chrome, the extracted extension can be installed permanently.

### Connect to gopass

The connection to gopass is achieved via the native messaging API.
For this a native messaging manifest must be configured for your browser.

Since **gopass v1.12** `gopass-jsonapi` has moved to its own repo where the binary can be downloaded and unpacked from the
[archive files on Github Releases](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass-jsonapi/releases).

It is recommended that you set up the manifests with `gopass-jsonapi` as described in the 
[gopass documentation, "filling passwords from browser"](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass/blob/master/docs/setup.md#filling-in-passwords-from-browser).
In most cases it is enough to run `gopass-jsonapi configure` and follow the tutorial.

More details about Native Messaging can be found in the [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/nativeMessaging)
and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging) documentation.

### Change default shortcut

On firefox, you can change the shortcut via "manage extension shortcut" in the extension menu. 
In Chrome under "keyboard shortcuts" in the hamburger menu in extensions.
