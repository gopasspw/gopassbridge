# gopassbridge

A web extension for Firefox and Chrome to insert login credentials from [gopass](https://github.com/justwatchcom/gopass)

## Summary

[Gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) is the awesome command line password manager. This plugin enables input of login credentials from gopass.
To access gopass, a native app has to be configured in the browser in addition to this plugin. 
The native app is a wrapper that calls gopass with the jsonapi parameter to communicate via stdin/stdout.

## Setup

### Install browser extension

#### Firefox Extension

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gopass-bridge/

#### Chrome / Chromium Extension

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gopass-bridge/kkhfnlkhiapbiehimabddjbimfaijdhk

#### Build and install browser extension from source

See `Makefile` release target. For Firefox, the development plugin can be installed only temporarily while for Chrome, the extracted extension can be installed permanently.

### Connect to gopass

The connection to gopass is achieved via the native messaging.
For this a native messaging manifest is necessary.

It is recommended that you set up the manifests with gopass as described in the [gopass documentation, "filling passwords from browser"](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass/blob/master/docs/setup.md#filling-in-passwords-from-browser).
In most cases it is enough to run `gopass jsonapi configure` and follow the tutorial.

If you prefer a manual setup, example manifest configurations and a wrapper for gopass can be found in the `native-app` directory of this repository. 
Adapt the wrapper and manifest and copy them to the correct locations.

More details about Native Messaging can be found in the [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/nativeMessaging) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging) documentation.
