`gopassbridge` uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request.

* If you plan to do something more involved, first raise an issue to discuss
  your idea. This will avoid unnecessary work.

The gopassbridge code must be fully reviewable also when installed as extension. 
Therefore, no 3rd party libraries and plain JavaScript must be used. Also keep your code as simple as possible. 

Modern JavaScript features can be used if they are supported by current LTS version of Firefox and Chrome.

Also add a comment to your pull request if you want the maintainer to prepare a new release of the Chrome and Firefox plugins.
